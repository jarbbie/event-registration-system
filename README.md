# Event Registration System

The Event Registration System is an application to manage event's attendees.
It contains
- User page : User register to the event
- Admin page : Admin qualify registered attendees

The project is using (I'm not sure if it's called) a monorepo structure to manage the project's architecture which separate frontend and backend into differents directories.

jsyk : This is my first PERN stack webapp. I'm practicing Docker and CI/CD in this project as well

## Repository Structure
```

│   ├── package.json
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   ├── public
